# Reference Output

This are known-good outputs from assembling files in the examples directory.  When the assembler is modified, the examples should be assembled again their list and hex files compared to these files.

If differences are found due to a bug fix, new versions of these reference files should be generated.

Note that a change in the assembler version will cause a difference in the first line of the list file.  There is no need to check in a new version of the reference files if this is the only difference.
